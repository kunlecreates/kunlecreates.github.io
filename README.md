# Kunle Creates - Portfolio Website

This is the **source repository** for my professional portfolio website, hosted at:
[https://kunlecreates.org](https://kunlecreates.org)

> Explore how I design, build, and deploy production-ready software systems and applications using cloud-native technologies, DevOps, and modern Java stacks.

> **Client Confidentiality Notice**:\
 Some showcased projects are **simulated case studies** based on real-world engagements which I contributed to as part of larger client contracts. To protect proprietary information, these projects were **independently re-architected and implemented** using public/open-source technologies.\
 While they exclude any client-owned source code or sensitive data, they accurately reflect the technical challenges, architectural decisions, and DevOps workflows I led in those projects.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains the code powering my **GitHub Pages** portfolio site. It serves as a central showcase of:

- Scalable Java-based applications
- CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes deployments
- Observability and monitoring best practices
- Interactive frontend demos and documentation

If you are a developer or technical assessor, this is where you can preview my technical breadth and delivery focus.
