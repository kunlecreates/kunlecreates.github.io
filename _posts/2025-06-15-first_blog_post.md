Deploying modern Java microservices requires more than code - it's about automating workflows, securing services, and observing performance. Here's a summary of the architecture and lessons learned building a production-grade Twitter-clone:

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Spring Boot** - REST APIs for user, message, and timeline services
- **Kubernetes** - Managed via Helm with custom values.yaml per environment
- **GitLab CI/CD** - Automated build/test/deploy workflows
- **OpenTelemetry + Jaeger + Prometheus + Grafana** - Full observability pipeline
- **JWT** - Stateless authentication between services

## 🔁 GitOps Workflow
1. Push to `main` branch triggers GitLab CI
2. Docker images built and published to private registry
3. Helm chart deployed to test/prod namespaces
4. Alerts and traces auto-populated in Grafana/Jaeger

## 📈 Observability in Action
One of the biggest benefits was unified observability:
- Trace microservice communication using Jaeger
- Monitor latency and throughput with Prometheus
- Correlate logs with Elastic and Kibana (future enhancement)

## 🤯 Lessons Learned
- Helm templating avoids duplicated K8s YAML
- OAuth2 Proxy secures dashboards
- K8s readiness probes are critical for trace collection stability

## 📌 Takeaway
A containerized Java app alone isn't enough. With CI/CD, Helm, and observability, you gain operational confidence and faster debugging, which is crucial for any modern engineering team.
