title: "From Monolith to Microservices: Lessons Learned"

<p>Over the past few months, I've been migrating a legacy Java EE monolith into a microservices ecosystem. This post shares lessons learned, key decisions, and technical pitfalls to avoid when tackling such a refactor.</p>

<h2>1. Refactor for Interfaces First</h2>
<p>Begin by extracting service interfaces and domain logic into modular components. This separation helps prepare the codebase for service decomposition.</p>

<h2>2. Observability Before Scale</h2>
<p>Ensure every service emits logs, metrics, and traces. A robust observability stack (I used Prometheus, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry) helps diagnose issues early.</p>

<h2>3. CI/CD Pipelines Are Non-Negotiable</h2>
<p>Introduce GitLab or Jenkins pipelines early. Each microservice should be independently deployable with Helm or Kustomize.</p>
